    description: "Software to calculate the Wtec index. Wtec is a regional TEC
    disturbance that is equal to the mean TEC variation (with periods less than
    the specified ones) amplitude for a single GPS/GLONASS site. One can make a
    multisite processing: the software calculates the corresponding index for
    each site. The maximum duration of the Wtec series is one year."
